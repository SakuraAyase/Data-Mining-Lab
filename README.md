# Data-Mining-Lab
Implementation of Deep Neural Networks for data mining class of CS, SCUT. 


Support for any structure of classification problems. You Just need apply a wee adjustment in load_data.py for some other dataset.

The dataset we use is [dataset](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Statlog+%28Image+Segmentation%29), from http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php

The network is implemented by Keras.

After training process, the pro will output Learning Curve, save as [save.jps](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25098957/56190441-c59a6b00-605c-11e9-81e2-b6016997d5a8.jpg) at the root. 
Like following:
