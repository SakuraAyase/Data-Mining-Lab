# Data-Mining-Lab
Implementation of Deep Neural Networks for data mining class of CS, SCUT. 


Support for any structure of classification problems. You Just need apply a wee adjustment in load_data.py for some other dataset.

The dataset we use is [dataset](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Statlog+%28Image+Segmentation%29), from http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php

The network is implemented by Keras.

After training process, the pro will output Learning Curve, save as "save.jps" at the root.
